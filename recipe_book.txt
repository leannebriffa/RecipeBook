1)Pasta Carbonara

	Ingredients:

		1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
		1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced
		1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)
		3-4 whole eggs
		1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
		1 pound spaghetti pasta (or bucatini or fettuccine)
		Salt and black pepper to taste

	Method:

		1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)

		2 Sauté pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.
		Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.

		3 Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.

		4 Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.

		5 Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
		Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
		Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)

		6 Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.

2)Homemade Pizza

	Ingredients:

		1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
		1 teaspoon sugar
		1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
		1/4 cup canola oil

		2.Turn onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.

		3.Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.

		4.Add some pasta water to thin out the sauce, if needed.

		2 eggs
		100g freshly grated vegetarian Parmesan-style cheese
		Nutmeg
		olive oil
		Rocket

	Method:

		3.When ready to cook, heat the oven to warm and bring a large pan of water to the boil. Reduce the heat to medium and drop in batches of about 8-10 gnocchi at a time. They will sink to the bottom, and when they rise to the top give them about 1 min more, then remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm while you cook the rest. Serve the gnocchi on warm plates drizzled with olive oil and scattered with rocket and more cheese.
