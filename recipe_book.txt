Fettucine Alfredo

Ingredients:
500g Fettuccine Pasta
90g Butter
1 Garlic Clove (minced)
355ml Heavy Cream
1/4 teaspoon Salt
100g Shredded Parmesan Cheese
1/4 teaspoon Pepper
    
Method:
In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. 
In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. 
Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.
Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.
Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.
Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.

Ingredients:
1 eggplant	
4 ounces mozzarella cheese	
2 tablespoons flour	
1 pound pizza dough	
8 ounces Nello's pizza sauce	
1 ounce ricotta salata	
1/8 ounce fresh basil	
1 parchment paper

Directions:
Prepare Ingredients
Preheat oven to 450°F. Rinse eggplant, halve lengthwise, and cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Tear mozzarella into small pieces.

Sauté Eggplant
Heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add eggplant in a single layer, working in batches if necessary. 
Season with ½ teaspoon kosher salt and pepper as desired. Sauté, flipping halfway through, until crisp on outside, about 8 minutes total. 
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

Roll Out Pizza Dough
While eggplant sautés, sprinkle flour onto a clean dry surface. 
Using a rolling pin or the heels of your hands, roll and stretch pizza dough to about ¼-inch thickness. 
Rub 1 teaspoon olive oil on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then carefully add pizza dough.

Assemble Pizza
Spread marinara sauce over pizza, leaving a 1-inch border. Add eggplant in an even layer. Top with mozzarella, then dot over ricotta salata.

Bake Pizza
Transfer pizza to bottom rack of oven and bake until crust is crisp and light golden and cheese is bubbling, 15-20 minutes. 
Meanwhile, rinse basil and tear leaves into bite-size pieces, discarding stems. 

Plate Pizza
Cut pizza into slices, garnish with basil, and dig in. Refrigerate any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
