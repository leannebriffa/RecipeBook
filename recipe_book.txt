1)Prawn Cocktail

	Ingredients:
    		75g light mayonaise
    		20g ketchup
    		dash Worcestershire sauce
    		200g cooked prawns
    		sprinkle paprika
    		lemon slices

	Method:
		Measure out the mayonnaise, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and mix them together in a bowl.
		Add the prawns and mix until completely coated, then cover and pop in the fridge until ready to serve.
		To serve, place spoonfuls of the prawn cocktail mixture onto small lettuce leaves or use as a healthy baked potato topping.
		Sprinkle over a little paprika and serve with fresh lemon slices on the side.

2)Bruschetta:

1.Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).
Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.
Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.
Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2.Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3.Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.
Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.

4.Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
The baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.
When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5.Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).
Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

3)Mushroom Soup

	Ingredients:
		2 tablespoons butter
		1/2 pound sliced fresh mushrooms
		1/4 cup chopped onion
		6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
		1/2 teaspoon salt
		1/8 teaspoon pepper
		2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) chicken broth
		1 cup half-and-half cream

Pasta Carbonara

Ingredients:

1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced
1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)
3-4 whole eggs
1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
1 pound spaghetti pasta (or bucatini or fettuccine)
Salt and black pepper to taste

Method:

1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)

2 Sauté pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.
Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.

3 Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.

4 Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.

5 Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.
Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.
Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)

6 Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.

Homemade Pizza

Ingredients:

1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
1/4 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon salt
3-1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 pound ground beef
1 small onion, chopped
1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
3 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 medium green pepper, diced
2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese

Method:

1. In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, a cup at a time, until a soft dough forms.

2.Turn onto floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over medium heat until no longer pink; drain.

3.Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.

4.Bake at 400° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.

Pesto Pasta

Ingredients:

1 cup of Basic Basil Pesto recipe
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/4 cup heavy cream
salt and pepper to taste
1 pound favorite pasta, cooked

Method:

1.Heat olive oil over medium heat.

2.Add pesto and mix into the oil. Be sure to stir often as the pesto warms.

3.When the pesto is warmed and just a little bubbly, slowly stream in the heavy cream as you stir. (You can always add more cream it you'd like.)

4.Add some pasta water to thin out the sauce, if needed.

5.Turn down the heat and continue to stir to incorporate the cream and pesto. Salt and pepper to taste.
