Fettucine Alfredo

Ingredients:
500g Fettuccine Pasta
90g Butter
1 Garlic Clove (minced)
355ml Heavy Cream
1/4 teaspoon Salt
100g Shredded Parmesan Cheese
1/4 teaspoon Pepper
    
Method:
In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. 
In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. 
Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.
Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.
Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.
Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.
